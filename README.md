## Magshimim Second Year, Advanced Programming Principles Class, Semester 1 Final Project
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

In our first semester's final project, we were asked to design & implement a backend for a chess game in C++, using SOLID principles.

As a bonus, me and my partner added some extra features to the frontend of the game and implemented features we were not asked to implement, such as checking for checkmate.

### Running the Project

The project was developed in the "Visual Studio 2019" IDE. By opening the `.vcxproj` files in Visual Studio and building the project you can test it on your own.
