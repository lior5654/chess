## Magshimim Second Year, Advanced Programming Principles Class, Semester 1 Final Project
-----------------------------------------------------------

In our first semester's final project, we were asked to design & implement a backend for a chess game in C++, using SOLID principles.

As a bonus, me and my partner added some extra features to the frontend of the game and implemented features we were not asked to implement, such as checking for checkmate.
